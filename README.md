# animation-website
just for fun i made this website also i want to try something new i have used #html#css#javascript#canvas
in this project i have animated a picture playing in the background and it moves as we scroll down in our page 
I have used cdn files such as gsap.mim.js , ScrollTrigeer.mim.js locomotive-scroll CDN files use css as well as js file of locomotive .
It contains 4 pages for animation.
I have used canvas because when the pages are moving canvas is fastly apllying the changes in the images show it is showing as if the video is being played.
